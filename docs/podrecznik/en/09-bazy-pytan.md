# 9. Question bases

## 9.1 What a question base is for

A question base is your library of questions to use again and again. It is not a ready game:
you can create a game from selected questions in the base at any time (→ 9.8).

The *Question bases* page has the "My bases" and "Shared" tabs — bases that other people
invited you to (→ 12). The filter above the list shows bases by role: Mine, Edit or Read-only.

- To create a base, click the "New base" tile and enter a name (up to 80 characters).
- To open a base, select it and choose [Browse|folder].
- For the selected base, [Share] (→ 12.2), [Duplicate], [Export] to a
  `.fambase` file and [Import] from a file are also available.
- You rename a base by double-clicking it, and delete it with the trash icon — only in your own bases.

You can move questions from a game to a base with the [Export to base] button in *My games* (→ 6.7).

## 9.2 The base explorer

An open base works much like a file explorer on a computer:

- **on the left** — the "Folders" tree, starting from the "Root folder", and below it the
  "Tags" and "Matching categories" panels,
- **in the middle** — the contents of the current folder: folders and questions,
- **at the top** — the toolbar and the search field.

Click an item to select it. To select several, hold Ctrl (⌘ on a Mac);
Shift selects a range. You can also select items with a frame by dragging from an empty spot.
The right mouse button (on touch screens — press and hold) opens a menu with actions for the selection.

You open a folder by double-clicking it or with the Enter key, and go up a level with the Backspace key
or in the folder tree.

## 9.3 Tools for working with questions and folders

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| [New folder], [New question] | creates an item in the current folder |
| [Edit question] | opens the question window (→ 9.7) |
| [Tags] | assigns tags to the selection (→ 9.4) |
| [Rename] | renames a folder or changes the question text |
| [Copy], [Cut], [Paste] | moves or copies the selection to another folder |
| [Duplicate] | creates a copy next to the original |
| [Delete] | deletes the selection — after confirmation, with no way to undo |
| [Create game] | creates a game from the selected questions (→ 9.8) |
| [Refresh view] | shows the latest state of the base |

**Dragging.** Drag the selection onto a folder to move it. With Ctrl held down
(Option on a Mac) the items will be copied — a folder together with its contents. Dropping onto an empty
background moves the items to the "Root folder". Dragging onto a tag in the left panel assigns
that tag.

Deleting a folder also deletes everything inside it.

## 9.4 Folders and tags

**Folders** can be nested as deep as you like, and you can organize questions in them by topic,
round or event.

**Tags** are labels independent of folders — one question can have several tags, for example
"sport" and "easy".

- In the [Tags] window, choose [Add tag], enter a name (up to 40 characters: letters, digits and `_`, no
  spaces) and choose a color.
- Select questions or folders, and in the [Tags] window tick the tags you want to assign to them.
  A tag marked as "partial" is on only some of the selected items.
- A tag assigned to a folder goes to all the questions in it, including those in subfolders. A folder
  shows the tag marker only when all the questions inside have it.
- Click a tag in the left panel to see only the questions with that tag. Several selected tags
  show the questions that have all of them.

The "Matching categories" under the tags are created by the app itself — they show the questions that already meet
the conditions of a given game type (→ 7.6):

- **standard** — suitable for a standard poll,
- **scored** — they have from 3 to 6 answers, so they are suitable for a "Points" game,
- **prepared** — they have from 3 to 6 answers with points (each at least 4, a total of at most
  100), so they are suitable for a prepared game.

## 9.5 Searching and browsing questions

Type text in the "Search..." field. The app will find questions and folders whose text or name
contains that text (upper and lower case do not matter; answers are not searched).
Type `#tag_name` to add a tag to the search.

When you search or filter by tag, the list shows results from the whole base, not the contents
of a folder — in this view you cannot paste or cut. To go back to the folders, clear the search
field or deselect the tags.

## 9.6 Keyboard shortcuts

Shortcuts do not work while you are typing text in fields.

| Action | Windows / Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| New question | Ctrl+N | ⌘N |
| New folder | Ctrl+Shift+N | ⌘⇧N |
| Edit question | Ctrl+E | ⌘E |
| Tags | Ctrl+T | ⌘T |
| Rename | F2 | F2 |
| Delete | Delete | Fn+⌫ |
| Copy / Cut / Paste | Ctrl+C / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+V | ⌘C / ⌘X / ⌘V |
| Duplicate | Ctrl+D | ⌘D |
| Select all | Ctrl+A | ⌘A |
| Open folder | Enter | Enter |
| Folder up | Backspace | ⌫ |
| Deselect | Esc | Esc |
| Refresh view | Ctrl+Alt+R | ⌘⌥R |
| Create game | Ctrl+G | ⌘G |

Some browsers use some of these shortcuts themselves (for example Ctrl+N opens a new window).
In that case, use the button on the toolbar.

## 9.7 Editing a question

Double-click a question or choose [Edit question]. In the "Question" window:

- "Question text" — up to 100 characters,
- [+ Answer] — up to 6 answers, each up to 17 characters,
- "Points" — optional, from 0 to 100 for each answer; a total of at most 100.

Points are not required in a base — they come in handy if the question becomes part of a prepared game.
The same limits and characters apply in the game editor (→ 7.3, 7.4). You assign tags separately (→ 9.4).

## 9.8 Creating a game from selected questions

1. Select questions or folders and choose [Create game].
2. In the "Export game" window, enter the game name and choose the type: standard poll, scored or
   prepared.
3. Check the list: the selected questions (including those from selected folders) are already chosen. You can
   add or deselect questions from the whole base.
4. For each question and in the summary you can see what is missing for readiness — for example
   "Ready once created." or "A draft will be created. Missing for ready: …".
5. Confirm. The game will appear in *My games*.

The game is created from exactly the selected questions — the app does not add missing ones. It does not have to meet
the readiness conditions: you can create an incomplete draft and complete it in the editor (→ 7.6).

The chosen game type decides what gets carried over: a standard poll keeps only the questions,
scored — questions and answers without points (the points will come from the poll), and a prepared game —
questions, answers and points.

You cannot create a game from a base you only have read-only access to (→ 12.4).
